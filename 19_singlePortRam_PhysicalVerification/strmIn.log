WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'ram' is attached to the technology library 'ts018_scl_prim'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
WARNING (XSTRM-107): Existing cells in the target library will be overwritten if the cell names in the Stream file and the target library are the same. To prevent this, set the '-writeMode' option to 'noOverwrite'.

WARNING (XSTRM-155): Ignoring the Stream layer-datatype pair '235:0' at row '1' in the object map file '/run/media/user1/c2s/cadence/install/SCL_PDK/scl180/pdk/cdns/sclpdk_v3/HOTCODE/amslibs/cds_oa/cdslibs/ts18scl/devices/ts018_oa_compana_4M1L/rev2.0/ref_libs/ts018_scl_prim/ts018_scl_prim.objectmap' because it is also defined in the layer map file. Additionally, shapes in GDS on '235:0' with properties indicating they were translated from objects in the OpenAccess database will be translated back to objects. The remaining shapes will be translated to shapes.
